# ðŸ“œ Transcript Verifier - CollegeApp Module

## ðŸ“˜ Description

`TranscriptVerifier` is a Move module under the `CollegeApp` namespace, designed for secure and decentralized management of academic transcript verification. It allows students to upload hashed versions of their academic transcripts and enables colleges to verify them on-chain. This approach ensures integrity, transparency, and tamper-proof validation of educational credentials.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

To build a trustless and transparent system for academic institutions and students, where verification of credentials is seamless, decentralized, and immutable â€” reducing fraud and increasing trust in digital transcripts across the globe.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

* **Integration with IPFS/Arweave**: Store actual transcript files securely while keeping only the hash on-chain.
* **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Link transcript data with student identities using DID frameworks.
* **Multi-tier Verification**: Enable department-wise or professor-level validations before final approval.
* **Event Emission**: Add on-chain events for better traceability and off-chain indexing.
* **UI/Portal**: Develop a frontend for students and institutions to interact with the smart contract.
